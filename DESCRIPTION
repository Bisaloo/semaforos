  measure implemented by the Mexican federal government during the COVID-19 
  pandemic to mitigate to virus propagation. They are graduated across 4 colors

  and restrictions. Each Semáforo is defined for a given state for a period of
  one week before being re-evaluated in the light of new epidemiological data.
